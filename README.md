# MNIST-Classifier
A simple MNIST Classifier using a Neural Network in PyTorch along with a simple GUI and canvas interface.

Lots of room for improvement

- using convolutional neural network instead
- augmenting MNIST database to prevent overfitting
- using juypter notebook to help debugging
- making the GUI nicer
- organizing code better
- adding a better drawing tool with different thickness
